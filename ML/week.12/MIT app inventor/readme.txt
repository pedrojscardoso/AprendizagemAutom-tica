To run the project you need to set up the following:


API/Server:
1. start the Flask server by running the `iris_API.py` script in the upper directory

App:
1. install the App Inventor Companion App on your phone (Android or iOS)
2. open the App Inventor website on your computer (https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu)
3. create a new project
4. design the app (like in app_design.png)
5. implement the logic using blocks (like in app_logic.png)
6. on the menu click 'Connect' > 'AI Companion'
7. test the app on your phone by opening the Companion App and scanning the QR code

As an lasy alternative you can use the `iris_classifier.aia` file to import the project into App Inventor and skip some of those steps.
