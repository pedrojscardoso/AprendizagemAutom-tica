This repository contains the material for the Machine Learning course of the Systems Engineering and Computer Technologies (LESTI) degree of the University of Algarve.

The course is taught in the 1st semester of the 2nd year of the LESTI degree.  The course is taught in Portuguese, but the material is in English.

Most of the material is in the form of Jupyter notebooks, which can be viewed directly in GitHub, but to run them you need to install Python and Jupyter. 
The easiest way to do this is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and use the [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) to install Jupyter.

Other options include the use of:
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which allows you to run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.
- [DataSpell](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) with the [Jupyter extension](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/jupyter-notebook-support.html)

For a quick start, and also advanced work, you can use the last option ([DataSpell](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/)), which is free for students and teachers (see https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). 

Finally, for a quick start regarding Jupyter notebooks, you can use the following links:
- [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial: The Definitive Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook)
- [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial: Introduction, Setup, and Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk)

## Local installation (in short)
For a local installation, you need to install Python and then Jupyter
```
pip install jupyter
```

Then, open a terminal and type
```
jupyter notebook
```
and navigate to the folder where you have the notebooks.

Some of the notebooks require the use of some libraries, which you can install using the following commands:
```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
```
